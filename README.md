# Joey's Portfolio
Building a portfolio with React, using Firebase Authentication and Firestore 

## Currently a work in progress
In the current state, you can login with Google Auth (via Firebase) but cant do anything more than that
Once complete, after login, you will see my Resume.

Happy coding
